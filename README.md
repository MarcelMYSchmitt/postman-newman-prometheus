# Introduction

Repository contains postman collection for testing an URL which is secured by oAuth. We need to get a bearer token for accessing the URL. 

<br /> 

## Setup

The folder `newman` contains a dicker file and the collections for running a docker container locally and natively with Newman. The folder `nodejsÂ´ contains a small application for doing the same stuff. The difference is that the NodeJS App provides a prometheus extension for scraping endpoints / executing postman tests regularly and providing the specific metrics.

<br /> 

### Run Newman Docker Image locally 

Go to `newman` folder an execute following command:  
`docker build -t mrmyiagi/postman_runner .`

<br /> 

Run the built container by using following command:  
`docker run mrmyiagi/postman_runner run test/PARTER_URL_TEST.postman_collection.json --insecure --env-var "CLIENT_ID=1234" --env-var "CLIENT_SECRET=1234" --env-var "SSO_URL=sso_url.com" --env-var "PARTNER_URL=https://partner_url.com"--environment="environment/ENVIRONMENT.postman_environment.json" --reporters cli --reporter-cli-no-failures`

<br /> 


### Run Docker Image with NodJS

For running the tests in Kubernetes we create a NodeJS in which we run the test collection with a prometheus extension where we can publish metrics. Please check before building and executing if PROXY Settings/Configration is needed. At the moment you have to set it in code manually. When build and pushed into a docker registry, you can then deploy the image by using a helm chart, where you defined / set the environment variables. Please add the scraping configuration for Prometheus to your deployment file, so Prometheus will be able to scrape the endpoint regularly. The endpoint will be available under `/metrics`.
